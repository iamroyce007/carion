            <h2>Innovative Rear Seat Car Entertainment System</h2>
            <p>This cutting-edge car entertainment system is designed exclusively for rear-seat passengers, ensuring driver safety and comfort while offering an unparalleled in-car experience. Unlike conventional systems, it eliminates the need for costly touchscreens by featuring a high-resolution display controlled via a remote, making it a cost-effective and user-friendly solution.</p>
            <p>Preloaded with popular OTT apps, the system allows passengers to stream their favorite content during long journeys. A unique software integration takes it further—when a smartphone is connected, the system’s interface seamlessly transforms into a TVOS-inspired platform. This adaptive mode supports all compatible mobile apps, enabling features like video conferencing. The phone’s camera functions as a webcam, providing a high-quality video communication experience.</p>
            <p>To prioritize safety and avoid distractions, the system is restricted to the rear seats, keeping the driver’s focus on the road. Additional safety features include a dedicated headphones-only mode, ensuring external sounds do not interfere with the car's environment. This feature is particularly useful in vehicles equipped with multiple systems, preventing audio overlaps and maintaining a quiet, distraction-free atmosphere for the driver.</p>
            <p>By combining cost-effectiveness, advanced software integration, and thoughtful safety measures, this system revolutionizes rear-seat entertainment. It caters to the needs of modern passengers who seek entertainment and productivity without compromising the driver’s safety or increasing production costs.</p>
